## Features

- Functional programming paradigm
- Static typing with type inference
- Higher-order functions
- Pattern matching
- Lazy evaluation
- Custom data types
- Standard library
- REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/antioop.git
   cd antioop
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the following before running test files
   ```
   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/antioop:$PYTHONPATH

   pytest tests/test_lexer.py
   ```
